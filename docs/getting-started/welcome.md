# Welcome to MCPBay

## What's MCPBay

MCPBay is an "all in one" [MCP](miscs/about-mcp.md) administrator. It allows users and developers to
create, version, publish, and discover reusable AI contexts.

## Why MCPBay

With the AI boom we're living through, more and more people, developers, technologies, and businesses are trying to adapt to the latest LLMs released each cycle.

Meanwhile, mid to senior-level developers and established businesses can afford the time investment required to learn and understand the [MCP protocol](miscs/about-mcp.md), as well as to write, publish, and maintain their MCPs. Regular users, on the other hand, are looking for cheaper and faster solutions to create robust MCPs.

## What can I do with MCPBay?

MCPBay offers a wide range of [capabilities](capabilities.md) that enable the construction of very robust MCPs capable of handling most project requirements.

To give you some ideas...:

- Distribute non-sensitive (for now) information and resources along the members of an organization.
- Extend LLM functionalities with custom tools.
- Create predectible IA responses for your documents.
- Connect your AI tools to your git repository to send full-explained PRs.
- Document your projects.
- Create personalities for your LLMs.

And some more funny ideas:

- Use the MCP to allow an LLM play a game.
- Connect an LLM to a free LLM to delegate easy tasks.
- Connect your MCP to your friend's AI tool to make it do wrong every task he requires.
- Find by yourself a 0-ring vulnerability on both Android and iPhone devices to install your new MCP (I don't know how) into your crush's phone to make it explode when she calls you "friend". (Illegal, better don't...)
