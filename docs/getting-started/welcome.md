# Welcome to MCPBay

MCPBay is a "all in one" MCP administrator. It allows users and developers to
create, version, publish, and discover reusable AI contexts.

## Why MCPBay

With the AI auge we're living, more and more people, developers, technologies, and business are trying to adapt to the latest LLMs released every cycle.

Meanwhile mid/senior level developers and stablished business can handle the time investion on learn and understand the MCP protocol, and write, publish, and update their MCPs. Normal people are looking for more cheaper and fastest solutions to create robuts MCPs

## What's an MCP

An MCP is the name given to programs that, following the MCP protocol, extend the capabilities of an LLM (commonly used through an AI tool such as ClaudeCode) by providing specialized information (context), as well as working tools and even templates to obtain deterministic responses from the LLM (prompts).

## What's the MCP Protocol

A protocol is a guideline for how to do something. In this case, MCP (Model Context Protocol) describes the structure and transport mechanisms that information and communication must follow in order to extend LLM knowledge and capabilities.
