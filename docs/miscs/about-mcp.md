# About MCP

## What's an MCP

An MCP refers to programs that, by following the MCP protocol, extend the capabilities of an LLM (commonly used through an AI tool such as ClaudeCode) by providing specialized information (context), as well as tools and even templates to obtain more deterministic responses from the LLM (prompts).

### What's the MCP Protocol

A protocol is a guideline for how to do something. In this case, MCP (Model Context Protocol) describes the structure and transport mechanisms that information and communication must follow in order to extend LLM knowledge and capabilities.
